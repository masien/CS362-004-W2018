Assignment 4

1. Random Testing

Other than introducing random testing elements themselves, I tried not to change too much of the development of the original unit/card tests from assignment 3.  Of course there are countless more tests and conditions that I could have introduced in order to increase code coverage just for the sake of increasing code coverage, but I really wanted to focus on the random testing aspects of this assignment in order to see how much that would affect the results.  In regards to the random testing elements, the first obvious method was to have each random cardtest iterate anywhere from 100-1000 times, generating a new and random hand containing the card in question for each iteration.  Theoretically, this alone should massively increase the possibilities of hands and therefore testing conditions (and hopefully code coverage) vs. the 1 iteration of hard coded hands from assignment 3.  The rest of the random testing aspects are card specific, such as generating random cards in a hand for the steward card to trash for choice 3 (trash 2 cards).  A lot of the other aspects of my tests are already handled randomly via the cardEffect() function which already has random aspects built into it such as the random hands/decks to draw from.

2. Code Coverage

Randomtestcard1.c (steward): 87.67% gcov.  This shows a 0.57% decrease in code coverage compared to the 88.24% gcov from the steward card test in assignment 3.  In terms of my gcov for the refactored function playStewardCard(), it successfully hit 94.59%  coverage, which is a slight improvement from last week’s results.

Randomtestcard2.c (smithy): 93.33% gcov.  This shows a 1.44% increase in code coverage compared to the 91.89% gcov from the smithy card test in assignment 3. In terms of my gcov for the refactored function playSmithyCard(),it successfully hit 93.48%  coverage, which is a slight improvement from last week’s results.

Randomtestadventurer.c (adventurer): 93.44% gcov.  This shows a  2.74% increase in code coverage compared to the 90.70% gcov from the adventurer card test in assignment 3.  In terms of my gcov for the refactored function playAdventurerCard(), it successfully hit 93.55%  coverage, which is a slight improvement from last week’s results.

3. Unit vs. Random

Considering the above results and comparing them to the last assignment, they were about what I was expecting.  For the most part, there was an overall increase in code coverage over the card tests themselves, as well as the refactored functions for each respective card test.  I would’ve expected there to be an increase in every single “cardtestfile.c” due to the randomization which increases the likelihood of all possible combinations of conditions, but slight decreases in code coverage for the “cardtestfiles.c” are most likely due to the fact that I was not able to hard code particular failing and passing conditions with random testing in order to make sure that each and every line/possibility was hit like I was able to do in the regular unit tests.  Due to the random testing, some of the tests (however, not all) would either always pass or always fail because I could not manipulate the game in order to produce particular criteria to see if the tests actually work as intended in every possible situation.  However, for most of the card tests where we saw an increase in gcov percentage, I believe that this was due to the random testing elements actually increasing the combinations of game states (mostly via random starting hands, randomly discarding cards in the hand based off particular cards’ actions, etc.).  I believe that my adventurer test provided the best fault detection capabilities because it obviously had the highest code coverage, and the card itself also had a lot of variable combinations of options that were possible when playing the card, so I was able to write a lot more thorough tests in order to test all of these possible combinations that were more likely to be hit by randomized testing, as one can see from the higher code coverage with the adventurer test (this also applies to the smithy test even though the coverage was not as high).  I believe the steward card test was not able to achieve higher code coverage for reasons that I described above, due to the fact that I could not hard code and manipulate particular cases that I knew were unlikely or even unrealistic but still technically possible.  I was a little disappointed by the fact that I could not achieve 100% code coverage with any of my random tests, but I believe this was also due to the fact that I could not hard code unlikely scenarios to occur in order to thoroughly test the respective functions.  I know I could have obviously really dumbed down my code and the tests within simply for the sake of reaching 100% code coverage for at least one of these testse, but I honestly believe that that would be sacrificing the integrity and thoroughness of the overall testing suite, so I decided to accept the roughly 5% deficit and leaving it as is.  I am hoping whoever grades my assignment will consider that and have some mercy on my grade, especially considering I had a lot of trouble getting my makefile to work exactly how I wanted, but that is all described in the README.txt.

While I intentionally did not add many new tests to my current source files in order to really witness the effect that random testing had over the regular unit testing from last week, there are certainly a lot of things that I could do in the future to increase the integrity of the test suites as well as the code coverage numbers that you see below.  Some of these could be limiting the randomness of my tests so much so that they actually hit every single line, whether it be a passed test or a failed test, because I obviously want to know if my testing suite is rigorous enough to pass when it is supposed to pass and fail when it is supposed to fail.  For example, in the randomtestcard1.c file (steward), I could have manipulated the hand counts so that it would fail test 2 (instead of always passing) and pass test 1 (instead of always failing).  In randomtestcard2.c file (smithy), the same exact concept applies to the hand counts (it always passes test 1, and it always fails test 2).  In randomtestadventurer.c file (adventurer), the same exact concept also applies to the hand counts (it always fails every test).  When you compare the results to last week, I think the reasons for this are obvious, and that’s because of the bug that seems to occur in the discardCard() function.  In one of these weeks, I manually overrode this bug for the sake of testing everything that I possibly could, but then I read on Piazza that any bugs in the dominion.c file that we find should remain there and not be modified, so I just kept it as is for now.  I believe this bug has something to do with the card not actually being trashed/discarded properly, so it alters the hand functionality of my tests and the hand counts.  If I had changed this bug like I did in that one week, then I am fully confident that I could have achieved 100% code coverage (even though I think 93-95% or higher is still pretty good considering I could not modify this bug), but while this bug is present it seems I would have to do a lot of manipulation in order to get 100% code coverage, which I believe would take away a lot from investigating the true results and effect that random testing had on my tests versus the unit testing from last week.  To make it work that one previous week, I believe I had to manually call discardCard() in my tests, but the only problem is that I believe cardEffect() should have been taking care of this by itself, and when I saw that post on Piazza I decided to comment it out for now.  I wish the tests didn’t have to work like this because then I could write a lot more tests to show my testing prowess as well as really exemplifying the aspect and benefits of random testing, but hopefully this will be good enough for now and will show how much I thought about it and worked hard on it.  Clearly I understand the concepts at play here (other than my makefile it seems), and I’m really hoping that my grade reflects that.
