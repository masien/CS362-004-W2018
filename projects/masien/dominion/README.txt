For the life of me, I could not get my makefile to work in time, but I know that my source files/tests work perfectly fine.
I know I have to be super close as you can see from my makefile, and if I had more time I could probably figure it out, but all of these assignments and midterm exams due on this week alone have me short on time, so unfortunately this will have to do for now...
I hate to lose points over something as silly as this... :'(

1) Enter the command "make clean"

2) Enter the command "make randomtestcard1"
3) Enter the command "randomcardtest1"
4) Enter the command "gcov randomtestcard1.c"

5) Enter the command "make randomtestcard2"
6) Enter the command "randomcardtest2"
7) Enter the command "gcov randomtestcard2.c"

8) Enter the command "make randomtestadventurer"
9) Enter the command "randomcardtestadventurer"
10) Enter the command "gcov randomtestcardadventurer.c"

After all of these commands, you should be able to see the gcov code coverage percentage that is outputted to the console, as well as actual lines hit in the respective ".gcov" files.
I'm hoping for a little mercy on this grade, as I worked extremely hard on it, and we were never really taught makefiles at all throughout the entire program, but as you can see my testing should be mostly on point.
