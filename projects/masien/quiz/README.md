To compile AND run the program, simply enter the command "make all".  This command will not only compile the testme.c program, but also create the testme executable in addition to automatically running that executable.

After the program is complete, if you want to run the program again, you will either have to enter the executable "testme", or enter the command "make clean" and then "make all" again, otherwise the makefile will give you an error that says the file is already up to date.

Please message or email me if you have any questions or issues, and I'd be glad to take care of them ASAP.  Thanks!
